# COVID-19-Prediction-for-San-Diego-County

This is a Research Project in which 2 group members and I predicted the number of new cases in the near future for the end of 2022. We managed to receive COVID-19 data from San Diego County and perform data cleaning on the data to process the data into our Machine Learning Models. We utilized Linear Regression, but realized there was a limitation to Linear Regression when trying to predict too far into the future. We then decided to switch to the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model, which is more ideal for time series predictions.
